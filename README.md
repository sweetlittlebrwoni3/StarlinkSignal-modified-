## This User's notes:
In this repo I made some minor changes to the main code provided in (https://gitlab.com/radionavlab/public/ut-starlink-signal-simulator) with no changes made to the functionality of the code.
I also added a directory called RX which has functions for the estimation part mentioned in this paper: [https://radionavlab.ae.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/komodromos_starlink_simulator.pdf].
** Note that there's still a lot of work to be done about this project and the project is not finished yet.
Feel free to let me know if there's any suggestion or changes you want to make regarding this repo: me23778@hotmail.com
